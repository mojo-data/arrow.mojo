Apache Arrow in Mojo

This repo is very much a work in progress. The goal is to provide a way to use Apache Arrow in Mojo. This is a very early version and is not yet ready for use.

## Dev Setup

Install magic by following the instructions [here](https://www.modular.com/docs/magic/install).

You should be able to just run 

```bash
magic run test
```


The magic project file contains the tasks:
- `magic run test` - Run tests
- `magic run dist` - Builds the distribution package
- `magic run build` - Build the package
- `magic run clean` - Clean up build artifacts
